    <h1> Contract Termination Letter</h1>
    <div>
        Mr. Jack Johnson  , <br>
        Vice President  , <br>
        Johnson Delivery Service  , <br>
        25 South Street   , <br>
        Fort Worth, TX 76052  . <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        Dear Mr. Johnson, <br>
        <br>
        This letter is being written to confirm that as of tomorrow 12/02/2010, I will no longer need to use Johnson
        Delivery Service. I have been pleased with our prior relationship and it is my wish that we part on good terms,
        I have decided to use another delivery service due to their ability to serve me sooner in the morning.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        My contract agreement with Johnson Delivery Service for the calendar year expires 12/31/2010. Please use this
        letter as our notice not to renew that contract. This is outside the standard 20 days notice required by the
        contract that I signed. Please feel free to contact me with any additional issues you may have regarding this
        contract termination letter.

        <br>    
        Best Wishes,

        <br>
        John Williams
